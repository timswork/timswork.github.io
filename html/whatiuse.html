			<h3><i>How the magic happens</i></h3>
			<div id="TimText">
				<br>
				<h4>SMARTPHONE</h4>
					<p>My life depends on the rock-solid <strong>Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max</strong>, and the triple cameras are awesome for capturing those magic moments in top quality. Actually, I became an iPhone fan with my 2009 iPhone 3GS, and I've used one ever since. iPhone gives you all the latest operating system features, the hardware takes a licking and keeps on ticking, and 'it just works' (infamous statement by Steve Jobs, on the simplicity and reliability of Apple products).</p>
				<h4>COMPUTERS</h4>
					<p>My 2011 <strong>Apple MacBook Pro</strong> is still going strong, after all these years; it's build like a tank, and I've upgraded the storage and memory (something you can't do with the new MacBooks). I dread the day that this dies, as there is no current Apple laptop that I feel good with throwing thousands of dollars at anymore; my next stop may well be a premium Windows 10 laptop.</p>
					<p>No rig would be complete these days without a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>, would it? My Pi 4B lives to help me out in a pinch, when I need to securely browse the Internet from prying eyes and hosting a WireGuard VPN for safe browsing on public WiFi!</p>
					<p>At work I do run a <strong>Microsoft Windows 10 PC</strong> to keep my Windows skills sharp, especially since I am responsible for an entire Windows Active Directory network domain.</p>
				<h4>TABLET</h4>
					<p>A 2018 <strong>Apple iPad</strong> helps me out when I want to kick back and parse media, or for note-taking at seminars. It was a Christmas gift from my folks, and it goes with me everywhere - along with a very cool <strong>Apple Pencil</strong> for drawing and handwriting.</p>
				<h4>READING</h4>
					<p>The <strong>Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 3</strong> goes pretty much everywhere with me, either in my backpack or satchel, for whenever I want to work through some books. Currently I'm reading Craig Carlson's Pancakes In Paris, since someday I want to go visit with my cousin who lives in Paris; it's a great read, and teaches you some business skills and good things to know about the French.</p>
				<h4>GAMING</h4>
					<p>Count me in with the new <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>! Once the Super Mario Odyssey bundle came out, with the awesome red Joy-Cons, I could resist making the Switch no longer! It's been a long year of waiting to find something that compelled me to purchase the Switch, but now I'm a happy owner of Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Snipperclips, Super Mario Maker 2, and the fun Luigi's Mansion 3.</p>
					<p>I recently picked up a <strong>New Nintendo 3DS</strong> and I think the 3D games are amazing - especially Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7, and some Professor Layton puzzles. Previously, for years I owned the Nintendo DS Lite; and the 3DS plays all the previous DS Lite games I have built up.</p>
					<p>There's a <strong>Microsoft Xbox One S</strong> in my condo mostly for Redbox and Blu-Ray movies, but you could occasionally find me playing Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, and Burnout Paradise. Having a Blu-Ray disk player is a huge benefit of having the Xbox One, especially when renting Redbox movies.</p>
				<h4>TELEVISION</h4>
					<p>You will find a 47-inch<strong> LG LED SmartTV 47LM6400</strong> in the middle of my condo, for your 3D widescreen viewing pleasure. Cable is there to catch the latest shows, compliments of my condo building!</p>
					<p>Along with that, there is an <strong>AppleTV 4th Generation</strong> to display Netflix, YouTube, TWiT, music, etc. - pretty much as good as it gets for big-screen Internet awesomeness.</p>
				<h4>GEAR</h4>
					<p>We all need to organize, and I have several great bags for that. A backpack for my daily needs, which is sturdy enough to carry my computer when needed. A leather satchel is there for the lighter engagements of visiting cafes, and looking a little more sophisticated. An older, deprecated backpack is in reserve, when I get down and dirty with the heavy-lifting of biking somewhere to carry things around.</p>
